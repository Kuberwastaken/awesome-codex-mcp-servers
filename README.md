# Awesome Codex MCP Servers [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated, hype-free catalog of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that give **OpenAI Codex** hands and eyes — across the Codex CLI, the IDE extension, and Codex cloud.

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard for connecting AI apps to external tools, data, and services. Codex is the **client (host)**; each server below exposes tools, resources, or prompts that Codex can call. Because MCP is a standard, most of these servers also work in Cursor, Claude, and other clients — the only thing that changes is the config format. If you're on Claude, see the sibling list: **[awesome-claude-mcp-servers](https://github.com/Kuberwastaken/awesome-claude-mcp-servers)**.

This list favors **signal over volume**: servers that people actually run, that are maintained, and that do one thing well. Every entry is tagged so you can scan by language, where it runs, and who stands behind it.

## How to read this list

Every entry looks like this:

```
- [Name](link) - What it does, in one plain sentence. `Lang` `runs` `source`
```

The trailing tags are the fast-scan metadata:

**Language** — `TS` TypeScript · `Py` Python · `Go` Go · `Rust` Rust · `C#` C# · `Java` Java · `JS` JavaScript · `Ruby` Ruby

**Runs** — `local` runs on your machine as a subprocess over stdio · `remote` a hosted HTTP endpoint you point Codex at · `local/remote` ships both

**Source** — `reference` an official reference server from the MCP project · `official` maintained by the product's own vendor · `archived` an archived reference server, still usable but no longer maintained. Entries with no source tag are community-maintained.

No stars, no install counts — those go stale the day you write them. Popularity lives in the [Starter kits](#starter-kits) instead.

## Getting started with Codex

MCP servers connect over two transports: **stdio** (a local subprocess) and **streamable HTTP** (a remote endpoint, optionally behind OAuth). Codex keeps both in one file — `~/.codex/config.toml` — and the CLI and IDE extension share it.

### Add a server from the CLI

Add a **local (stdio)** server. Everything after `--` is the command Codex will launch:

```bash
codex mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~/Projects
```

Add a **remote (streamable HTTP)** server with a bearer token read from an env var:

```bash
codex mcp add github --url https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ \
  --bearer-token-env-var GITHUB_PAT
```

Manage them with `codex mcp list`, `codex mcp get <name>`, and `codex mcp remove <name>`. Inside the Codex TUI, `/mcp` lists configured servers. Run `codex mcp --help` to confirm the exact subcommands on your version.

### Or edit `~/.codex/config.toml` directly

A **local (stdio)** server is a `[mcp_servers.<name>]` table:

```toml
[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

# Optional: forward specific environment variables to the server
[mcp_servers.context7.env]
CONTEXT7_API_KEY = "your-token"
```

A **remote (streamable HTTP)** server uses `url` plus the name of an env var holding the token:

```toml
[mcp_servers.figma]
url = "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

Useful per-server knobs:

| Field | Default | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `startup_timeout_sec` | `10` | How long to wait for the server to initialize. Raise it for slow first-time `npx`/`uvx` downloads. |
| `tool_timeout_sec` | `60` | Per-tool execution timeout. |
| `enabled` | `true` | Turn a server off without deleting its config. |
| `enabled_tools` / `disabled_tools` | — | Allowlist or denylist tool names to keep the surface small. |

### Enabling streamable HTTP

Remote MCP support in Codex rides on an experimental Rust MCP client that has been stabilizing across releases. If a `url`-based server won't connect — or its OAuth login fails — enable the client explicitly, then re-check `codex --version`:

```toml
# Newer builds:
[features]
rmcp_client = true

# Older builds used a top-level flag instead:
# experimental_use_rmcp_client = true
```

Streamable HTTP on Windows is the roughest edge right now; stdio servers are the most reliable path there.

### Same config, CLI and IDE

The Codex IDE extension reads the **same `~/.codex/config.toml`**, so a server you add once works in both. A project-scoped `.codex/config.toml` overrides it, but only loads once you've marked the project as trusted.

## Starter kits

You do not want thirty servers. Every server's tool definitions are spent from the same context window as your actual work, and Codex gets worse at picking the right tool as the count climbs — keep it lean and use `enabled_tools`/`disabled_tools` to trim noisy ones. Install a small set that matches what you're doing.

**The coding stack** — the high-leverage set for Codex CLI:

- [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) - up-to-date, version-pinned library docs so Codex stops guessing APIs.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) - issues, PRs, code search, and Actions, so Codex participates in the repo.
- [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) - drive and verify a browser for UI work and end-to-end checks.
- [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) - symbol-level code navigation and edits for large codebases.
- [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp) - pull real production errors and stack traces while you fix them.

> The first launch of an `npx`/`uvx` server downloads the package, which can blow past the default 10-second startup window. If a server flaps on first run, raise `startup_timeout_sec` before assuming it's broken.

**The knowledge stack** — for research, writing, and automation:

- [Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) - turn any URL into clean markdown.
- [Brave Search](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server) - real-time web grounding.
- [Filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) - let Codex read and write local files.
- [Memory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) - persist facts across sessions.
- [Notion](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) or [Obsidian](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian) - connect your knowledge base.

## Safety and good hygiene

MCP hands a model real capabilities. Treat every server like a dependency you're installing with credentials attached.

- **Install servers you trust.** A malicious server can hide instructions inside its tool descriptions (tool poisoning) and can change them after you approve it. Prefer `reference` and `official` servers, or read the source.
- **Scope credentials down.** Give database and API servers **read-only** access to anything production, and use fine-grained, least-privilege tokens. A GitHub PAT for an agent should not be able to force-push.
- **Prompt injection is real.** A server that reads external content — a GitHub issue, a web page, an email — can carry instructions that try to hijack the agent. Keep write-capable and content-reading servers separate where you can.
- **Mind the token budget.** Each server's tool definitions cost context before any work happens; some large servers cost tens of thousands of tokens. Fewer, sharper servers beat a kitchen sink.
- **Pin versions.** Pin `npx`/`uvx` package versions for anything sensitive, and bind local HTTP servers to `127.0.0.1`.
